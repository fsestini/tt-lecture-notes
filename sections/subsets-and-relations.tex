\section{Subsets}
\subsection{Basic definitions}

\begin{definition}[Subset]
  Subsets and their elements are defined as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $X$ be a set, and $D$ a unary property (or predicate), that is, a
    \emph{proper}\footnote{Recall that a proposition is said to be proper, or
      small, when all the \emph{quantifiers} which appear in it range only on
      sets.} proposition depending on \emph{one} argument in \(X\).
    Then, \(D\) \emph{is} a \newdefn{subset} of \(X\).
  
  \item If \(D\) is a subset of \(X\) and \(\inj{x}{X}\), we say that \(x\) is
    an \textbf{element} of \(D\), written \(\injsubexpl{x}{X}{D}\), if \(x\)
    satisfies the property \(D\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The subscript in a subset membership judgement will be implicit most of the
time. Do take notice how we are using the notation \(\insub\) instead of the
more familiar \(\in\). The reason will be apparent presently.

\begin{example}
  Let, for example, be \(S\) the students of the University of Padua
  and \(M(s)\) - a \emph{proper} proposition depending on \emph{one}
  argument in \(S\), where \(M(s)\) if \(s\) is studying for a degree
  in Mathematics.
  
  We will write \(\injsubexpl{\text{Marco}}{S}{M}\) to denote that Marco is
  indeed pursuing a degree in Mathematics - and \(M\) also models the
  notion of the subset of mathematics students.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $C$ be a collection.
  Consider $L(s) \equiv$ ``$s$ is friends with every element of $C$''.
  $L$ is not a subset (it's not proper).
\end{example}

Since \(D(x)\), just like any proposition (or, in this case, propositional
family on X) respects equality of \(X\), membership in \(D\) also necessarily
respects it:

\[
  \forallconn{x,y}{X}{(\implconn{\injsub{x}{D} \wedge x\ =_X\ y}{\injsub{y}{D}})}
\].

This leads to a natural formulation of equality between subsets.

\begin{definition}[Subset equality]
  Two subsets \(D, E\) of a set $X$ are equal when an element \(\inj{x}{X}\) is
  in \(D\) iff is in \(E\):

  \[
    \forall D, E \subseteq X,
    \implconn{\forallconn{x}{X}(\injsub{x}{D} \iff \injsub{x}{E})}{D = E}
  \]  
\end{definition}

The collection of subsets of \(X\), with this notion of equality, is denoted by
\(\setpow{X}\) and called the power collection of $X$ (\strong{not} powerset,
for reasons that will soon be apparent) of \(X\).

Before moving on, we introduce some notation for later.

\begin{notation}
  Let \(\varphi\) be a proposition depending on an argument in a set \(X\).

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item We will write \((\exists \injsub{x}{D})\varphi(x)\) in lieu of
    \((\exists \inj{x}{X})(\injsub{x}{D} \wedge \varphi(x))\) and
    \((\forall \injsub{x}{D})\varphi(x)\) in lieu of
    \((\exists \inj{x}{X})(\injsub{x}{D} \rightarrow \varphi(x))\);
  \item If \(\varphi\) is unary \emph{and} proper, then
    \(\{\inj{x}{X} : \varphi(x) \}\) is a subset;
  \item We write \(D \between E\) in lieu of \((\exists \injsub{x}{D})E(x)\)
    and \(D \subseteq E\) in lieu of \((\forall \injsub{x}{D})E(x)\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{notation}

\subsection{Properties (and un-properties) of subsets}

We now enumerate some properties of subsets thus defined; we also
highlight some properties which are usual in ZFC and no longer hold
under the definition\footnote{It is to do a disservice to the subject
  to define it in terms of \emph{how it differs from ZFC}.  However,
  the intended audience of the series of lectures that this document
  accompanies is one mostly or exclusively familiar with ZFC and, all
  too often, unaware of it. We try to eliminate misconceptions
  first.}.
% TODO: further expand on the topic and its philosophical motivations.
% TODO: cite sambin/valentini
The first un-property is:

\[ \text{No subset can be \emph{assumed} to exist.} \]
% TODO: use something better than an equation environment...

A subset arises when we can define it by a \emph{property}. If no property is
given, no subset can be drawn out of thin air
\footnote{Note that in classical (ZFC-based) mathematics we can conceive the
existence ``of more subsets than propositions'', if we assume propositions to be
formulas over an alphabet with countably many symbols. This is not the case
here; one proposition, one subset.}.
Moreover, subsets of a set do not form themselves a set, but only a collection,
since it can be shown by diagonalization that it is impossible to
generate all subsets of a set by a fixed finite number of rules.
This is in contrast with the \strong{powerset axiom} of classical set theory,
which postulates the existence of a set of all subsets of any given set.

The second is:

\[ \text{Subsets are not sets.} \]

Subset and set are different concepts altogether.
This is immediate from the definition: the logical type of a subset
is that of a propositional \emph{family} over a set, which is
different from a set.
In fact we can also write \(\injsub{y}{D}\) as
\(y \in \{x \in X : D(x)\}\); this is why we choose to use \(\insub\)
for subsets.

Besides the fact that sets and subsets are different by definition, there is a
profound reason why we can't allow subsets to be sets in the familiar way.
In ZFC-based mathematics, subsets are, of course, sets - by the
\strong{axiom of separation}, which states that given any set $A$,
there is a set $B$ such that, given any $x$, is a member of $B$ if and
only if $x$ is a member of $A$ and some property $\varphi$ holds for $x$.
In other words, the axiom of spearation allows to define
$B \subseteq A$ by ``filtering'' elements of $A$ by some property
$\varphi$.

Allowing the axiom of separation in our theory would give rise to
severe inconsistencies.
Consider the property

\[ U(x) = \text{``the Turing machine with index
  $x$ does not stop on input $x$''} \]

It's a well known result of computability theory that there are no effective
rules to generate the elements of $\{\inj{x}{N} : U(x) \}$.  Therefore, if we
did allow the axiom of separation, we would be faced with the fact that there
are sets for which we do not have rules to effectively construct its canonical
elements, in open contrast with the constructive principles we've so far built
our theory upon.

\[ \text{There is no notion of a}\ \strong{complement subset}.\]

Or at least, the usual notion of complement in classical set theory does not
find any correspondence in this setting. In fact, \(\complset{\complset{D}}\) is
just \(\{ x \in X : \neg\neg D(x) \}\). Proving $D = \complset{\complset{D}}$
would require the classical law of double negation, or equivalent principles.

\begin{example}
  This example, which may or may not be satirical in intent, is due to
  \cite{basicpicture}.

  Let \(R\) be the set of residents of Italy.
  
  \[ H(x) \equiv \text{``}x\ \text{is honest''} \]
  
  \(H \subseteq R\) is the subset of honest residents.
  \(\inj{r}{R}\) not being exposed as dishonest is not sufficient to say that
  \(\injsub{r}{H}\):
  
  \[ \notinjsub{x}{\complset{H}} \not\Rightarrow \injsub{r}{H} \]
\end{example}

\subsection{Relations and functions}
Until now we've dealt with \emph{unary} propositions.

\begin{definition}[Relation]
  A \newdefn{relation} $R$ between $X$ and $S$ is a \emph{binary} proper
  proposition, i.e. depending on two arguments:

  \[ \hpropj{R(x, y)}{x \in X, y \in Y} \]
\end{definition}

the order of arguments is relevant, in general, and thus we say that
$R$ is a relation \emph{from} $X$ \emph{to} $S$ and write
$R : X \rightarrow S$.

From the fact that propositions preserve equality, we have that a relation
preserves equality as well:

\[
  \implconn{
    \andconn{x =_X x'}{a =_S a'}
  }{
    (R(x, a) \iff R(x' , a'))
  }
\]

\begin{definition}[Functional relation]
  Let $X,S$ be sets, and $R$ a relation from $X$ to $S$.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $R$ is \newdefn{total} if every element \(x \in X\) is related to at
    least one element \(a \in S\), that is, if
    \((\forall x \in X)(\exists a \in S)R(x, a)\) holds.

  \item $R$ is \newdefn{single-valued} if every \(x \in X\) is related to
    at most one element in $S$, that is, if

    \[
      \forallconn{x}{A}{
        \forallconn{y,z}{A}{
          (\implconn{
            \andconn{R(x,y)}{R(x,z)}
          }{
            y = z
          })
        }
      }
    \]

    holds.

  \item $R$ is called a \newdefn{function} if it is total and single-valued.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Consider relations $R$ over the set of natural numbers.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $R(x,y) \equiv  x \geq y$ is total, not single valued, not a function;
  \item $R(x,y) \equiv (x = 2y)$ is single valued but not total; not a function;
  \item $R(x,y) \equiv (x = y)$ is total and single valued, hence a function;
  \item $R(x,y)\ \equiv\ \forall s \in \mathcal{P}(\NN) \top$ is not a proper proposition,
    therefore not a relation!
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
  
%\begin{example}
%  \[ R(x,y) : x, y \in N \]
%  \[ R(x,y)\ \text{iff}\ \forall s \in P(N),  \{x, y\} \subseteq s \]
%TODO: this one is a relation, why?
%\end{example}

The \newdefn{collection of relations} from $X$ to $S$ is denoted by
$Rel(X, S)$.  The \newdefn{collection of functions} from \(X\) to
\(S\) is denoted by \(Fun(X, S)\).

Consider an operation $\hinj{p(i)}{X}{\inj{i}{I}}$. The subset of $X$ defined
by $\existsconn{i}{I}{(x =_X p(i))}$ is called the \newdefn{image} of \(I\)
along \(p\).

As subsets of a set, also relations and functions between two sets
form a collection, and not a set, since there are no rules to
generate all of them.

\subsubsection{Operations and functions}

Every operation \(p\) from a set \(X\) to a set \(S\) determines a
function \(\hat{p} : X \rightarrow S\), called the \newdefn{graph} of
\(p\), s.t. .  $\forall x \in X, a \in S$:

\[ \hat{p}(x,a) \equiv (a =_S p(x))\]

While every operation determines a function, it is \strong{not} the case that
every function determines an operation, since defining an operation $p$ requires
to be able to give instructions to yield the output $p(x)$ from a given argument
$x$
\footnote{To reinforce this we go as far as choosing the letter $p$ to suggest
  ``program''}.
It is a classic result of computability theory that there are
functions (called uncomputable functions) for computing which there
does not exist an effective operation or algorithm. Therefore not all
functions admit an operation.

Note, moreover, that as the theory we are describing is extensional, also
equality between operations is extensional:

\[
  p = q \iff \forallconn{x,y}{X}{p(x) = q(x)}
\]
